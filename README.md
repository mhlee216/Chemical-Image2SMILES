# Chemical-Image2SMILES (Toy Project)
I'm just suggesting an idea with a simple example to convert a compound image to a SMILES string.

#### Method
Image => Skeleton => Graph => Mol => SMILES

#### Problems
- Difficult to make nodes to vertices from skeleton
- Difficult to know what symbols of atoms from nodes are
- Difficult to recognize other than single bonds
