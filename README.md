# Chemical-Image2SMILES
I just only suggest an idea with a simple example for converting chemical compound images to SMILES strings.

#### Method
Image => Skeleton => Graph => Mol => SMILES

#### Problems
- Difficult to make nodes to vertices from skeleton
- Difficult to know what symbols of atoms from nodes are
- Difficult to recognize other than single bonds
